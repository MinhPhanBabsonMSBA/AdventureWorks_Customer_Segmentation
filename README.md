# 🧠 Customer Segment Analysis Report
 
**Tools:** SQL (BigQuery), Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze customer purchase data to identify and understand customer segments based on behavior and demographics. By querying data with SQL in BigQuery and presenting insights via a Jupyter Notebook, the analysis provides data-driven recommendations for improving customer retention and targeting.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Segment customers by purchasing behavior and demographic data
- Identify high-value, high-frequency, and at-risk customers
- Generate actionable insights to inform marketing strategies

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **SQL (BigQuery):** Data querying and transformation  
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Analysis and presentation  
- **Python (optional):** For visualization or additional processing

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Customer Segments Identified:**
  - 🏆 High-Spenders: Customers with large basket sizes
  - 🔁 Frequent Shoppers: High purchase frequency, lower spend
  - ⚠️ One-Time Buyers: Purchased only once — high churn risk

- **Marketing Suggestions:**
  - Loyalty programs for frequent shoppers
  - Upsell strategies for high spenders
  - Re-engagement emails for one-time buyers
